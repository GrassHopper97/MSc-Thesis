# Description

The Scripts are used to calculate and generate rainfall grids, using Geostatistical and Deep Learning based interpolation methods, as the requirement of the thesis work, __Comparitive Analysis of Rainfall Surface Generation Using Deterministic, Stochastic and Deep Learning Methods__ 

* __Kriging and Regression__ file contains the scripts for Universal Kriging and Regression Kriging for spatial interpolation.

* __MoNet_GMMConv__ has the scripts for Gaussian Mixture Model based Neural Networks, using "GMMConv" module to perform spatial interpolation.

* __Test_Elevation__ is to add the Elevation values from any Digital Elevation Model (DEM), [_SRTM was used here_], to add to csv files containing rainfall data, for recorded locations. 

* __Data__ folder contains a few amount of data from the set of all the data, that was used in this thesis.
